<br>i needed a job, and the first place i saw was hiring was a pool supply <br>store. pool supply store. floaties, pool toys, other pool shit. yeah <br>okay. i walked in
<br>hey can i get an application?
<br>you wanna fill that out here?
<br>uh..</br> 

<br>i had a pool supply store job. they wanted me to come in tomorrow. they <br>closed in on me
<br>so looking for a job-?-yeah we’re hiring right now to start training for <br>summer, man it’s gonna get busy-it’s not now, but it will be. can you <br>come in tomorrow? 
<br>and that was that. 
<br>i drove home a little depressed.</br> 

<br>when it was really slow, we would all stand at the back door of the <br>warehouse building smoking, 
<br>the boss just going on, 
<br>yeah man some people don’t know how to take care of their pool ya know, <br>and then the chemistry is all outta wack and you spend $200 bucks getting <br>it back to normal - ha. my pool-
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-your pool? dude you don’t own that pool ha-ha. 
<br>well i mean, it’s mine in i take care of it -
<br>yeah okay. <br>

<br>i walked into the pool store on my day off. 
<br>yeah man i uhm, i’m sorry but i just got another job and they want me to <br>start now -so uh i don’t work here anymore. 
<br>ah i understand, he tells me. no worries - and all that. 
<br>it was over quickly. i leave without saying bye to anyone. <br>i didn't really have another job. just back to where i’d be back in the same <br>away from pool supplies.
