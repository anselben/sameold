<p>Those who do

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

I stand around with those who don’t know my 
name 
and who don’t want to ask
colleagues 
coworkers 
peers
whatever you want to call them. 

We have a meeting 
for work
to tell us how excited we should be
how busy we will be
and how if we sell more and more 
then we’ll get free lunch 
one day
not that i’d be there 
as i’m temporary.

It was the last time for a while that i’d see my friend
and he came to meet me at 1
and we walked to my car
in the sea of cars
sea of asphalt and cars
and smoked a joint 
blowing clouds into the summer 
of cerritos.

I changed my shirt 
and 
went back to work
to a 
useless station
air conditioned
they said how sorry they were 
to see me go 
And to those whose names i don’t know
I said i’m sorry 
too</p>
