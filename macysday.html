<br>i stand around with those who don’t know my 
<br>name 
<br>and who don’t want to ask
<br>colleagues 
<br>coworkers 
<br>peers
<br>whatever you want to call them. 
<br>
<br>we have a meeting 
<br>for work
<br>to tell us how excited we should be
<br>how busy we will be
<br>and how if we sell more and more 
<br>then we’ll get free lunch 
<br>one day
<br>not that i’d be there 
<br>as i’m temporary.
<br>
<br>it was the last time for a while that i’d <br>see my friend
<br>and he came to meet me at 1
<br>and we walked to my car
<br>in the sea of cars
<br>sea of asphalt and cars
<br>and smoked a joint 
<br>blowing clouds into 
<br>cerritos.
<br>
<br>i went back to my day 
<br>my last day 
<br>
wondering mostly<br>
where i might
<br>be
<br>they said how sorry they were 
<br>to see me go 
<br>and i don't know their names but said
<br>i said i’m sorry 
<br>too
