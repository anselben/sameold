on
<br>the 
<br>5 
<br>freeway
<br>

<br>we stared at the road at the orchards and forest that surrounded us. flying on adrenaline and some top shelf bud. <br>we lifted our spirits on days of nothing. 
<br>
<br>we were kicked out of a skatepark later on that day, as we entered an empty open concrete canyon. 
<br>“hey this is bike day!” some asshole yelled out from behind. 
<br>we look around
<br>“bike day?”
<br>“yeah. annd you gotta pay to get in”
<br>we looked and turn
<br>yeah whatever 
<br>as he followed us out
<br>of the empty
<br>park.
<br>
<br>
the summer made everyone a piece of shit. it was always summer, we were always pieces of shit."
