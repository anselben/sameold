     do not

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</br></h1>

<br>I stand around with those who don’t know my
<br>name 
<br>and who don’t want to ask
<br>colleagues
<br>coworkers 
<br>peers
<br>whatever you want to call them.</br></p>

<p><br>We have a meeting
<br>for work
<br>to tell us how excited we should be
<br>how <a href="busy we will be.html">busy we will be</a>
<br>and how if we sell more and more
<br>then we’ll get free lunch
<br>one day
<br>not that i’d be there
<br>as i’m temporary.</br></p>

<p><br>It was the last time for a while that i’d see my friend
<br>and he came to meet me at 1
<br>and we walked to my car
<br>in the sea of cars
<br>
<a href="roll-5004-1.gif">sea of asphalt and cars</a><br>and smoked a joint 
<br>blowing clouds into the <a href="winters.html">summer </a><br>of cerritos.</br></p>

<p><br>I changed my shirt
<br>and
<br>went back to work
<br>to a
<br><a href="Screen Shot 2017-01-16 at 5.18.47 PM.png">useless station</a>
<br>air conditioned
<br>they said how sorry they were
<br>to see me go
<br>And to whose names i don’t know
<br>I said i’m sorry
<br>too</br></p>
