<br>freeway

<br>
we stared at the road at the orchards and forest that surrounded us. flying on adrenaline and something like san fernando valley (sfv) og. <br>we lifted our spirits frequently on nothing. 
<br>
<br>we were kicked out of a skatepark later on that day, as we entered an empty open concrete canyon. 
	<br><i>hey this is bike day!</i> some asshole yelled out from behind. 
<br>we look around
	<br><i>bike day?</i>
	<br><i>yeah. annd you gotta pay to get in</i>
<br>we looked and turn
	<br><i>whatever.</i> a loss for words. a power dynamic we found ourselves on the bottom of, as the glaring sign reads <i>private property</i> giving us a final verdict.
	<br>he stood behind as
<br>he followed us out
<br>of the empty park.
<br>
<br>
the summer made everyone a piece of shit. it was always summer, we were always pieces of shit.
