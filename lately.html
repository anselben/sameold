<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>lately things seem to be coming and going more often. they always were before, but in a slightly different way now. the day seems to require less experience, leaving you constantly unaware. the clock makes sudden jumps from 9:43 am to 11:13 am, and before you knew it the sun had leaped across the sky before you could even make it outside. every moment becomes an instant memory, and remembering becomes a habit you are less and less aware of.
