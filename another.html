it was a nother long day, the kind that would creep into you. the kind where you look for something to do for the whole twenty four hours and fail to find a way. the kind where it doesn’t get dark when it’s light and it doesn’t get light when it’s dark. <br><br><br><br>



this day, almost like yesterday and probably like tomorrow i sit in a downright position looking up at the vibrating image, looking down at vibrating cubes floating in a vibrating glass. i reach back and even when my nose is stuffy and i breath quickly through my mouth the fermented corn shoots through my head reminding me of the last fifty years in an instant. <br><br><br><br>




sometimes i spend more time in digital space than real space. sort of like going on a drive. <br><br><br><br>



it stays on my breath, in my head, on my clothes, and leaks through my skin the next morning. it sits in the pit of my stomach for at least a week. <br><br><br><br>
